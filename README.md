## Challenge Overview 
We have to implement a transmitter (**send\_\*.m**) and a receiver (**reci\_\*.m**) for three seperate stages. The implementation is done in Matlab and will be graded in a manner similair to the events of **run_example.m** 

## Challenge Structure 
The challenge is conducted via the **testing_ground_3.m** function. This takes in the gamemode (challenge stage), function handles for the receivers from up to 2 teams and a boolean indicator that decides whether or not the messages are mirrored. 

The reciever and transmitter functions have essentially the same function signatures.
